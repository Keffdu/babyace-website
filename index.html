                <p>20 years after the Wright brothers first took flight, Orland Corben envisioned a world where everyone had access to their own personal aircraft, not just the rich. 
                He designed the first kitbuilt airplane, the Baby Ace, and the following year released a 2-seat version called the Junior Ace.</p>
